### 1.1	ABSTRACT

Pharmacy Management System is a small application developed using C++. In older days the Pharmacy used to maintain their records in books and papers. Here we propose a new system, using this application we can store the Details. In manual method if we forget information book then it very difficult to get the details. In manual mode it also becomes very difficult to update a particular record, also this system of storing data is inefficient. Some of the disadvantages of this manual system are:

-	Takes Up a Lot of Space. The biggest downfall to manual document filing is the amount of place it takes.
-	Prone to Damage and Being Misplaced. Manual document filing means you are placing faith in the people handling the files. 
-	Hard to Make Changes. 
-	Access Time.
-	Lack of Security. 
 
By using our application, we can see our data whenever we want, here we will have options like search record by name or using their id, insert new record and so on. In this project we can save our product id,cost, name, quantity and this all we can see at a time. This system is developed keeping in mind the general needs of the pharmacist while maintaining the records.


### 1.2	INTRODUCTION

We have to implement a Pharmacy Management System using C++ programming language. To accomplish this task, we will have to use some kind of database which will store all the records and will maintain the records as well. As our Pharmacy Management system has limited fields using a File to store this data will be a good choice. SQL database can also be used for this task but as the scale of the project is small, we do not need a proper database to store our information.
